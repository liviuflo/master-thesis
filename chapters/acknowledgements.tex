This work, as well as my fruitful IFRoS journey, would not have been possible without the direct or indirect contributions of several individuals, whom I would like to express my gratitude towards.

To Iván Eichhardt, my academic supervisor, for his availability, detailed feedback, and guidance throughout the final term.

To Max Fenkart, my industrial supervisor, for his enthusiasm, ambitious ideas, and patience with my scientific approach.

To Imma Guell, the IFRoS professors at Universitat de Girona, and Dr. Zoltán Istenes, for their initiatives and restless dedication to this programme.

To my fellow international colleagues, for their humor, peer support, perseverance and contagious eagerness to explore.

To Dr. Michael Tandy and my previous colleagues at Ocado Technology, for encouraging me to pursue this Master's Degree.

To my family, for their continued help and logistical efforts to make this process as smooth as possible.

To my fiancée, for her daily emotional support, inspirational resilience, heartfelt care, and being an unwavering source of motivation.

To God, my faithful \emph{refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble}.\footnote{Psalm 46:1, New King James Version}
