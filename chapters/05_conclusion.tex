\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

This work addressed odometry, a fundamental topic of mobile robotics, with emphasis on the area of perception, and was driven by its applicability to an industrial product, the SDX-Compact manufactured by Sodex Innovations GmbH. Range information from a 360-degree LiDAR sensor is fused with localization and orientation measurements provided by an INS, to increase robustness to GPS perturbations and enable 3D mapping quality beyond the accuracy of RTK-corrected readings.

We provided a review of the current state of research around this problem and its many facets. This was followed by a presentation of the hardware and data that we operate on, and a detailed explanation of the experiments conducted around each component of our final solution. Our contribution is an original displacement estimation method which relies on a two-step scan alignment process (robust ICP and Generalized ICP) and a factor graph structure, where registration results are combined with absolute GPS readings. To enforce point cloud registration constraints, we add ``skip connections'' between non-consecutive poses, based on the ICP-estimated displacement. GPS readings introduce unary factors which prevent trajectory drift and remove the need for a loop closure mechanism. The results show that our method is able to handle LiDAR scans captured at irregular time intervals, noisy GPS, or gaps in the sequence of GPS measurements.

We test our solution in multiple scenarios, with varying parameter configurations, and evaluate odometry on the KITTI dataset \cite{geiger2013vision} and on a custom dataset collected with the SDX-Compact. Unlike other odometry or SLAM approaches, we are also interested in the mapping quality --- the complete point cloud captured along the trajectory --- so we evaluate the output 3D map against GPS-only results. We obtain smoother and more fine-detailed maps, thanks to the registration constraints.

Guided by the research questions laid out in the initial stage of the project, the conducted work included multiple experiments which allow us to provide concrete and detailed answers.

    \item \textit{What metrics exist for measuring the accuracy of point cloud registration?}

    Point cloud registration can be evaluated in several ways, depending on the use case and the desired result. If ground truth displacement is available (\eg from an external sensor system or by designing a scene with custom objects which can be identified and localized precisely), it can be compared to the transformation computed by the registration algorithm.
    In most scenarios, however, registration accuracy is approximated as an error function between the two scans, after they have been transformed to a common reference frame. The metrics are a combination of distance measurements between 3D elements identified in both point clouds, such as points, planes, edges, etc., aiming to quantify the geometric consistency of the combined point cloud. Sensor noise and outliers introduce particular challenges, if a generic metric is sought. In our case, registration accuracy is indicated by the RMSE value obtained after applying GICP, which is a point-to-point metric. For further analysis, we direct the reader to \cite{adolfsson2021coral}.

    \item \textit{Can methods that use only visual information achieve higher quality point cloud registration (3D mapping) than merging based on RTK?}

    \item \textit{To what extent is LiDAR-based odometry an alternative to GNSS localization?}
